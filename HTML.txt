</html>
(iii) HEAD – <head> tag is the first element inside the <html> tag. It is used to provide information to the browser about the page and its contents.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques are written inside this tag. <title>, <meta> tags are written inside these tag. CSS and JS external links or internal CSS and JS are also written inside this tag.

<head>
           <meta charset="UTF-8">

Q #19) Define iframe in HTML.

Answer: Iframe tag is written as <iframe>.

An iframe is used to display different document content inside the different document content in a rectangular region in the browser. When different document content is embedded into a current HTML content, then it is known as an inline iframe.

The src attribute contains the path to the document that occupies the inline iframe.

<!DOCTYPE html>
           <html>
                       <head>
